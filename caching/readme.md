How Caching Helps: By storing frequently requested data in memory or a fast-access layer 
(e.g., Redis, Memcached), the application can serve subsequent requests more quickly.
Example: Instead of querying a database for the same user profile data repeatedly,
 store it in a cache and serve it instantly.
